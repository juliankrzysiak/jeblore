Hi, I'm Joanna, I have to give Jeb an allowance for his Robux, otherwise he will throw a tantrum and teleport to the trashcan and cry.

I also like to make art. I make all the Jeb comics and any other silly art featuring him and his friends.

Also, I didn't have any part in it! I didn't know Jeb wanted me to make a replica for an art piece! It's all on him!
